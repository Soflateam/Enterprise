This is my first project written in C#, so this project was a practice and proof of concept to act as an enterprise level employee and asset management system with HR integrations and software deployment capabilities.

This would allow tracking of all employees, including employment actions such as onboard/offboarding, asset tracking, and software license tracking features. 

Resizes images and keeps aspect ratios, then stores the smaller files locally, and it cleans up old data as it purges - with few exceptions due to tied up processes.

All functionality works, including data save/load, animations, and searching functionality.
